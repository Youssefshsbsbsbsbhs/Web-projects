            and dates of these quizzes. In general they cover the material from
            the previous lectures and are closed book.</p>
        <p><b>Lab exercises:</b>in the tutorial your tutor will review the
            completion of your completed lab exercises. You are encourage to
            attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so you
            have time to discuss any issues that arise with you tutor and have
            time to get them marked off.</p>
        <p><b>Assignments:</b>Parts 1, 2 and 3: are incremental instalments of a
            web site development task. In Part 1 you will demonstrate your
            ability to develop and deploy on a server well-structured, linked
            Web pages with text, graphics, tables and forms, styled with CSS.
            Part 2 further extends the use of HTML elements and makes use of
            JavaScript to validate forms and add dynamic behaviour to the Web
            page. In Part 3 you will use forms to submit and retrieve data from
            a server using PHP and MySQL. </p>
